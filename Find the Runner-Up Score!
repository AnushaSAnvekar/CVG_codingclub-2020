Problem:
Given the participants' score sheet for your University Sports Day, you are required to find the runner-up score.
You are given scores. Store them in a list and find the score of the runner-up.


Code:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    n = int(raw_input())
    arr = map(int, raw_input().split())
    x=max(arr)
    arr.sort()
    arr.reverse()
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        if arr[i]==arr[i+1]:
            continue
        else:
            print arr[i+1]
            break
