Problem:
Integers in Python can be as big as the bytes in your machine's memory. There is no limit in size as there is: 2^23 -1 (c++ int) or
2^63 -1(C++ long long int).
As we know, the result of a^bgrows really fast with increasing b.
Let's do some calculations on very large integers.
Task
Read four numbers,
a, b, c, and d, and print the result of a^b + c^d. 

Code:
a=input()
b=input()
c=input()
d=input()

eqn= (a**b)+(c**d)
print eqn
