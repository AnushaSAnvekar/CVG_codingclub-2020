Problem:
The provided code stub will read in a dictionary containing key/value pairs of name:[marks] for a list of students.
Print the average of the marks array for the student name provided, showing 2 places after the decimal.

Code:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    n = int(raw_input())
    student_marks = {}
    for _ in range(n):
        line = raw_input().split()
        name, scores = line[0], line[1:]
        scores = map(float, scores)
        student_marks[name] = scores    
    query_name = raw_input()
    for i in student_marks:        
        if i==query_name:                   
            sum1=0.00
            marks=student_marks[i]                       
            for j in range(0,len(marks)):
                sum1+=marks[j]                         
            x=sum1/(j+1)            
            print "%.2f" % x
